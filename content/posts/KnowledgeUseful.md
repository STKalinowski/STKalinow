What's the point in memorization if we can look things up, what's the point of learning if a model can do it for us. With LLMs, I've seen people questioning the need for writing, programming, and learning in general. But, knowledge and skills are still useful and will be useful in the future, it's just the emphasis and needs will change.

Socrates argued against writing, believing it would make people lazy. He was correct, it made us lazy, but wrong about it being a bad thing. It's good that I don't have to remember random things I need once in a while. We memorize what needs to be remembered. Using a library for a small project, I'm just gonna look things up in the docs. Using pytorch constantly for my projects, it's best I learn and commit it to memory. This is how it should be, learn what's needed. Writing, phones, LLMs, they just changing the definition of what's needed.

Regardless, learning, memory, and intelligence is important. Even though we don't have to do rote memorization right now, it's important to know and understand concepts. You use concepts to understand and make decisions. New technology doesn't change this fact. The reason intelligence matters is because part of intelligence is the usage of technology.

Knowledge itself is a compounding thing. The more you know, the more you can learn. It has a thresh-holding effect.

In Proust and the Squid by Maryanne Wolf, there was a great passage describing how kids learn to read. At first they struggle with each word, but once they accumulate enough knowledge, then suddenly at once they get the ability to read. It's a thresh-hold, they acquire enough knowledge about the surrounding words to infer on words they don't know.I believe the same principle applies to knowledge in general, the more you know, the more you are able to infer and grasp other ideas.

Better understanding and knowledge serves as ways to unlock technology, especially LLMs.

For LLMs, knowing more lets you use the models better. 

You can better communicate your desires, think about the levels an experience programmer can ask to write a program versus someone with no experience. 

You can better use the output. You can take the output and tweak it, or ask to correct it. As well as the model has more room to explain. Imagine explaining something to a child versus an adult, we have more words and analogies to use for the adult than the child. 

Brass tax, learning is still important, it lets you make better decisions and use tools better. Skills like programming, writing, analysis, etc, aren't going away. But they will change! So don't give up learning, just be open to the changes coming.
