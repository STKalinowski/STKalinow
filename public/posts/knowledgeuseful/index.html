I’ve seen people questioning the need to learn how to write, program, etc. But, the skills are still useful now and will be useful in the future, it’s just the emphasis and needs will change.\nSocrates argued against writing, believing it would make people lazy. He was correct about making us lazy, but wrong about it being a bad thing. It’s good I don’t have to remember phone numbers or random things I need once a year. We memorize what needs to be remembered. Using a library for a small project, I’m just gonna look things up in the docs. Using pytorch constantly for my projects, it’s best I learn and commit it to memory. This is how it should be, learn what’s needed. Writing, phones, LLMs, they are all just changing the definition of what’s needed.\nRegardless, learning and memory is important. Even though we don’t have to do rote memorization right now, it’s important to know and understand concepts to make decisions. New technology doesn’t change the fact that we need to focus on making better decisions, and technology is just a tool to help enable that. The reason we still need knowledge instead of passing everything off to technology is because part of knowledge is using technology.\nKnowledge it self is a compounding thing. The more you know, the more you can learn. It has a thresh-holding effect.\nIn Proust and the Squid by Maryanne Wolf, there was a great passage describing how kids learn to read. The at first struggle with each word, but once they accumulate enough knowledge, then suddenly at once they get the ability to read. Once they can pick up and use the context to infer on words they don’t know. I believe the same principle applies to knowledge in general, the more you know, the more you are able to infer and grasp other information.\nThen with better knowledge adn better thinking, these serve as ways to unlock technology, especially LLMs.\nIn the LLMs case, knowing more lets you use the models better. You can better communicate your desires, think about the levels an experience programmer can ask to write a program versus someone with no experience. You can better use the output. You can take the output and tweak it or ask to correct it. As well as the model has more room to explain. Imagine explaining something to a child versus an adult, we have more words and analogies to use for the adult than the child.\nI guess brass tax, learning things is important, it let’s us work with the tools better. All the skills like programming, writing, analysis, etc, are not going away! But they will change. So don’t give up learning, just be open change.\n",
